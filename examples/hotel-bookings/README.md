# 180Protocol - Hotel Bookings Use Case

For detailed instructions on how to set up and customize CoApps like this using the 180Protocol SDKs, please see

* [Writing your 180protocol CoApp](https://docs.180protocol.com/develop/tutorials/writing-your-180protocol-coapp)

## Introduction
This CoApp is a representative application built on the Aggregator SDK. The use case involves a coalition of hotels
who have come together to generate unique and tangible business insights from their private data sets. The data providers
are major hotels sharing their booking's data, including sensitive information about the customer including their 
age, address, party size, booking date and various preferences. 

The output of the data aggregation is a series of analytical insights that are available to the
data consumer. Such analytical insights are invaluable as they are not possible
to construct without a unique data sharing solution like 180Protocol. 

Read [Distributed Analytics](https://docs.180protocol.com/learn/sample-use-cases/distributed-analytics) on our wiki for 
understanding how 180Protocol powers a new kind of analytics.

### Provider Input Data
Each data provider is a hotel that shares individual booking's data broken down by the customer age, address, party size etc.
Such detailed booking data is sensitive and cannot be revealed by hotels to competitors or market research firms.

* Customer Age – Age of customer making booking
* Customer Address – Address of customer making booking
* Party Size  – Party size for booking
* Booking Date – Date for booking
* Room Price – Price for room booked
* Hotel Location – Location of hotel
* Furnished – Whether booked room is furnished 
* Booked Online – Whether booking was made online/offline
* Cancellation – Whether booking was cancelled 

e.x.,

| customerAge | customerAddress | partySize | bookingDate | roomPrice | hotelLocation | furnished | bookedOnline | cancellation |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| 34          |  "village"      | 5         |  "2021-03"  | 42        |  "City"       |  True     |  True        |  True        |
| 44          |  "small city"   | 6         |  "2021-12"  | 44        |  "small city" |  True     |  True        |  True        |
| 28          |  "rural"        | 6         |  "2022-01"  | 33        |  "London"     |  True     |  True        |  True        |
| 42          |  "small city"   | 1         |  "2021-07"  | 54        |  "town"       |  False    |  True        |  False       |
| 26          |  "rural"        | 1         |  "2021-03"  | 27        |  "London"     |  False    |  True        |  False       |
| 29          |  "London"       | 1         |  "2021-03"  | 40        |  "village"    |  True     |  True        |  False       |

### Consumer Data Output
Consumer data outputs are generated by the enclave based aggregator for the data consumer. In this use case, hotel bookings
analytics broken down by factors like customer age range, party sizes, and price range are calculated as outputs thereby 
revealing market level insights and data.

* Cancellations – by Age Range, by Party Sizes, by Online/Offline booking
* Furnishings – by Age Range, by Party Sizes, by Price Range
* Number of bookings – by month of booking made
* Average price of bookings – by month of booking made 
* Average party size – by month of booking made

### Provider Rewards
Data Provider rewards are calculated for each data provider (in this case hotels) by the enclave based aggregator.
Rewards are based on several individual factors that may differ for each use case and can be configured.
For this use case, the factors are:

* Amount Provided – Percentage of rows from the data provider out of the entire data set from all providers
* Uniqueness – Percentage of "customer age range-customer address region" combinations covered out of the entire data set
* Completeness – Number of distinct customer age ranges and customer address regions covered
* Update Frequency – Frequency of updates of the data over past few months

e.x.,
```JSON
{
	"amountProvided": 0.5,
	"completeness": 0.5,
	"uniqueness": 0.6666667,
	"updateFrequency": 0.71428573,
	"qualityScore": 0.5952381,
	"rewards": 59.523808,
	"dataType": "testSchema1"
}
```
To summarize, a hotel providing the most amount of booking data that covers broad types of customer age ranges and 
addresses regions, and one that is recent, stands to gain the most rewards.
